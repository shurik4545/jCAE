Version 0.16.0 (2008-08-18)

* Replace Java3D by VTK
* Selection in the tree will now highlight geometry shapes in the 3D view
* Selection on geometry vertices and edges
* Picking of mesh triangles

Version 0.15.0 (2007-12-14)

* Improved performance for cylindrical patches, meshing time is linear against the number of triangles.
* Full support for non-manifold meshes.
* Initial support for scripting.  A new jcae/groovy/ directory contains groovy scripts which can be used as-is or modified to fit special needs.  They are for now only available in Linux tarballs or from SVN (under amibe/groovy).
* Code cleanup in Amibe, in the hope that methods useful within Groovy scripts will not change.
* New amd64 tarball with full 64bit support.
* Include a "Getting Started" document in the distribution
* Upgrade to GNU Trove 2.0
* Fix bug 1800977: No black faces in ViewableFE
* Fix bug 1756713: Smooth and Decimate are broken
